#### Machine Learning Feasibility in Cochlear Implant Speech Perception Outcomes – Moving beyond Single Biomarkers for Cochlear Implant Performance Prediction <br>

This study evaluates whether machine learning models can predict 6‑month post‑implantation speech perception in cochlear implant recipients using only preoperative clinical data. In a large cohort (n=1,877) drawn from the HERMES national CI database and a single institutional registry, XGBoost models outperformed traditional linear/logistic regression using Lazard features, reducing mean absolute error for CNC word scores (17.4% vs. 18.4%) and AzBio sentence scores (20.4% vs. 21.6%). More importantly, XGBoost demonstrated better calibration and discrimination at the lower performance quintiles (AUROC ~0.71 vs. ~0.59) and excelled at identifying individuals at risk for poor outcomes.

This represents the first preoperative stratification model for CI speech outcomes; while performance gains are modest and prospective validation is needed, ML shows promise in guiding counseling, rehabilitation planning, and personalized clinical trial design.
